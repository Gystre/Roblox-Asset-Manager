# Roblox-Asset-Manager
Recently I had this problem of having a lot of roblox assets built up in a txt file. I needed a way to organize them in a scalable all in one solution which is why I made this program. It uses an locally hosted SQLite database to store all the metadata for the pictures on the back end and the .NET Framework for the front end. I'm quite happy with the result as it doesn't look very pretty but it gets the job done.
